                                SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR USING ARDUINO UNO
This project details the construction of a soil moisture sensor using an
Arduino Uno microcontroller. The sensor leverages the electrical conductivity
of soil to determine its moisture content. Dry soil conducts electricity poorly,
resulting in high resistance, while wet soil conducts well, leading to lower
resistance. By measuring this resistance and converting it to a readable value,
the Arduino can assess soil moisture.
The project outlines the materials required, including the Arduino Uno, a soil
moisture sensor module, and connecting wires. A clear circuit diagram guides
the connection process, ensuring proper power and signal flow. The Arduino
code is explained, detailing how it reads the sensor data, converts it to a
moisture percentage, and potentially displays the results on the serial
monitor or through other outputs like LEDs.
This project offers a fundamental understanding of soil moisture sensing and
its implementation with Arduino.
